## 1.1 Problem Definition
There are some Brain MRI images of some patients some patients have **Brain Tumour** and some do not have. So we need to build a model which can predicted tumour patients.

## 1.2 Data

Data is collected from Kaggle.com.

## 1.3 Performance Metric

- Logloss
- Confusion Matrics

## Model

- build CNN models from scratch
- reused VGG16 model.

## Model Evalution
- Log Loss : 0.33
- Accuracy : 90%
- FNR : 0.04
- FPR : 0.20
